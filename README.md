Github readme.md Syntax highlighting syntax code block 

Fenced code blocks
You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` ``` ```
before and after the code block.
We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

```
function Hello() {
  console.log("Hi Iam Hello Function");
}
```
# Syntax highlighting You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.

For example, to syntax highlight javascript code: use First line ```javascript .  Type Midle Your Code and last line type ```

```javascript
<script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>
```
